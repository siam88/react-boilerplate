<!-- # Getting Started with REACT BOILERPLATE

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## what you get when choosing this react boilerplate:

    - Translate
    - Redux
    - Folder structure
    - React Router v6
    - axios
    - theming

## Language Translation

### How to use translate

Currently I am adding two script for two language they are en to bn or bn to en. follow 6 steps to translate.

- **`Step 1` If you want to add new words to translate ,then go to your desire language file located in `src/locales/your_desired_file`**

- **`Step 2` I have added few words that are inside common object. If you want to group then then create a new object but one thing to remember that you have to add those objects in all the languages that you want to translate**

- **`Step 3` Inside your object follow this `[words.login]: "সাইন আপ"` pattern.I am using an example for better understanding**

- **`Step 4` Inside other language object follow this `[words.login]: "Login"` pattern too.**

- **`Step 5` There is a function in utils folder import it in your file `import Translate from "./utils/translate";`**

- **`Step 6` finally call the function and send two parameters. one is for languge that you want to translate and other is to sent a string like `"common.login"`.there common is for the object and after login is for the word we will use**

## Available Scripts

In the project directory, you can run:

### `npm start`

Runs the app in the development mode.\
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) to view it in your browser.

The page will reload when you make changes.\
You may also see any lint errors in the console.

### `npm test`

Launches the test runner in the interactive watch mode.\
See the section about [running tests](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/running-tests) for more information.

### `npm run build`

Builds the app for production to the `build` folder.\
It correctly bundles React in production mode and optimizes the build for the best performance.

The build is minified and the filenames include the hashes.\
Your app is ready to be deployed!

See the section about [deployment](https://facebook.github.io/create-react-app/docs/deployment) for more information.

### `npm run eject`

**Note: this is a one-way operation. Once you `eject`, you can't go back!**

If you aren't satisfied with the build tool and configuration choices, you can `eject` at any time. This command will remove the single build dependency from your project.

Instead, it will copy all the configuration files and the transitive dependencies (webpack, Babel, ESLint, etc) right into your project so you have full control over them. All of the commands except `eject` will still work, but they will point to the copied scripts so you can tweak them. At this point you're on your own.

You don't have to ever use `eject`. The curated feature set is suitable for small and middle deployments, and you shouldn't feel obligated to use this feature. However we understand that this tool wouldn't be useful if you couldn't customize it when you are ready for it.
